push_test.txt

When I pushed from Vagrant, that now reads UTC-5, which is correct, it shows that I pushed five hours ago on the file. On the repo (GitHub API), it shows I was working a minute ago.

Next tests:
- #1 git push from Terminal
then, if that doesn't work,
- #2 turn off UTC with VBoxManage
It was Value 1. Now I have changed to Value 0.
Last chance is None.

RESULT OF TEST #1 
- git push from Terminal and not within Vagrant has perfect time sync when it shows up in GitHub
