push_test.txt

When I pushed from Vagrant, that now reads UTC-5, which is correct, it shows that I pushed five hours ago on the file. On the repo (GitHub API), it shows I was working a minute ago.

Next tests:
- #1 git push from Terminal
then, if that doesn't work,
- #2 turn off UTC with VBoxManage
It was Value 1. Changed to Value 0, still doesn't work.
Last chance is None.

RESULT OF TEST #1 
- git push from Terminal and not within Vagrant has perfect time sync when it shows up in GitHub

RESULT OF TEST #2
- Switched UseUTC to 0. Same as when using 1 - GitHub says the commit was 5 hours ago (it's referenced as if the file was created in UTC).
Now trying UseUTC set to None. - This does not change the result.

In Vagrant, the correct time zone comes up. It is Etc/GMT+5. However, when the file is pushed, it compares the time stamp with UTC and says I did the work five hours ago. 
Vagrant knows what time it is. I guess Virtual Box still does not know what time it is.

TEST #3
Changing Users/jranpura/.vagrant.d/boxes/bento-VAGRANTSLASH-ubuntu-18.04/2020.12.21.0/virtualbox/Vagrantfile

File reads:

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?("vagrant-timezone")
    config.timezone.value = "UTC"
  end

Changing config.timezone.value = ":host"
Previously in my file it read Etc/GMT+5.
:host is not recognized as a valid time zone, and Vagrant will not run.

Current settings: UseUTC is at 0
Changing Vagrantfile code for timezone, trying different names.

Okay, now the guest says it is syncing. However, the time is always the time of here, of me. I need it to say my time and EST. That is not happening, though. What is happening is that the machine now thinks my local time is UTC.
That is why I am going to reset UseUTC to 1.

The best so far is "Etc/GMT+5", which reads accurately, even though it pushes to Git on UTC and makes it looks like I live five hours in the future.

Will do a test, then
TEST #4
I will change every Vagrantfile I can to include reference to the plugin.
